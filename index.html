        <strong>Problems:</strong>

        <br>
        <p id="Vandal" class="title"><b>Illegal graffiti (vandalizing):</b></p>
        <p>
            In today’s age there are a lot of talented people who wish to express their creativity in numerous ways like drawing, writing or composing music. Unfortunately, some of these ways are not as legal as others and include damaging other people’s property. An example of such a method of creative expression is the illegal graffiti drawings om buildings, cars and trains. These methods of art are very damaging for the victims as their property is often modified without their permission. Furthermore, when the graffiti is positioned at random, they destroy the vision of the city and its beauty as a whole. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            As way of battling these issues is the organization of art fairs and events where artists can freely express their individuality without the risk of criminal records and property damage. These events can be organized by the country on a national level or by the city in a more local tier. This way artists can show their talents to the general public, gain popularity and create future opportunities and conditions where their art can be used in enhancing beauty.  Furthermore, the government can create stronger rules and fines which discourage the vandalism and instead encourage the participation in other legal events and competitions.

        <p id="Cars" class="title"><b>Increasing number of active cars in cities:</b></p>
        <p>
            The importance of having your own motor vehicle becomes profound in new generations. It gives a sense of freedom and confidence along with enhancing one’s self-reliance. Furthermore, due to the continuous improvements in car manufacturing, cars become more and more affordable which allows for families to have 2-3 cars instead of 1. All these changes and improvements allow for the continuous increase in the number of running cars in cities around the world. Which leads to traffic jams, climate change, air pollution and increase in car accidents. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            A way of battling this problem is to improve the public transport around the world and encourage people to use the bus or a bike instead of their cars. Furthermore, the creation of public bike stations can encourage people to use bikes more often. In addition, the creation of safe bike lanes can provide people with a safe and fast method of transportation from one place to another. Moreover, organising different events where people can participate with different environmentally friendly vehicles like bikes, skateboards and roller skates can encourage people to use these typers of transport on a daily basis. Another stricter way of reducing the number of active cars is by implementing fees and taxes that require older and less environmentally friendly cars to pay before entering the city centre or other busy areas. By implementing these changes, the number of cars can be reduced, and people can start to have a healthier way of live.

        <p id="More" class="title"><b>Increasing number of homeless people:</b></p>
        <p>
            The cost of living and the increasing work competition makes it more and more difficult for people to maintain their way of live and forces them to lose their home and find themselves on the street. This way they are unable to return to the working part of society and fins a normal comfortable life. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            A way to combat this increasing problem is by crating organisations which help homeless people with their reintroduction to society by helping them find home, improve their skills and find jobs that they are really passionate about. Furthermore, by building more affordable housing it will be easier for people to keep their homes. Implementing rent control in order to stabilize housing cost and prevent people from ending on the streets. Creating special programs which help low-income individuals with rent can further improve their financial situation. Furthermore, by creating early prevention programs the government can locate individuals who are at risk of losing their homes and prevent this situation from becoming a reality. Organising free finance awareness and budgeting courses can educate people and show them the best ways to organise their finance and best ways of saving their money. Lastly, by providing mental support to individuals can prevent them from leaving their homes and instead work towards a better and happier future.  By implementing these changes, the number of homeless people will decrease and instead we will have a more organised and supported society where people will not be in danger of losing their homes.
